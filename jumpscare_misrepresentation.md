# Jumpscares are not the Problem

I came across a reddit post on /horror that finally spurred me to write my thoughts in full aobut jumpscare and how it has become such an easy and useless complaint people will consistently levy against horror movies they do not like. The [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/pwrw4p/jumpscares_dont_make_horror_movies_good_or_do_they/heiyrq3/) is as follows:
> This sub has taken the anti jumpscare stance too far.\
> Jumpscares are useful tools. Release of tension, management of threat, even the overall atmosphere of a movie among other aspects are able to be controlled with jumpscares.\
> They don't make a movie stupid or a one trick pony. Movies built as vehicles for jumpscares do that to themselves by choice and for a reason. As simple popcorn entertainment without weight. Something seen in just about every genre and subgenre. Nothing wrong with that.\
> This sub has, as a whole, taken the later and equated any significant use of jumpscares with that whole flavor of movies. It's a leap of logic based on distaste for 'flicks' rather than 'movies' or 'films'.\
> The presence of jumpscares is irrelevant in the weight or depth of a movie. It's the absence of everything else.

And [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/pwrw4p/jumpscares_dont_make_horror_movies_good_or_do_they/hejtatq/):

If you don’t mind I’d like to add even more thoughts around the use of jump scares within media, and its use as a term.

I came across a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/n5i1ip/this_is_a_judgmentfree_zone_what_are_your/gx3pva8/) a couple months ago that I think sets up a good basis of understanding as we move forward.

> It's such a trendy, cool kid sounding, but ultimately empty form of criticism of horror to dismiss jump scares like you're the first to notice it can be used cheaply to no effect. And it's bullshit to blame the brush rather than the painter.\
> Pretty much all the great horror movies have a form of a jump scare in one way or another.\
> It's just a fucking technique. It's used badly sometimes, a lot of times, like everything. But it's popular because in capable hands it can work wonders and has worked wonders for decades.\
> If you tell me you don't like horror movies with jump scares either you don't like horror movies or you don't know what a jump scare is.\
> "But so and so terrible movie is filled with just cheap jump scares", well, you know what, I bet you the jump scares are not the reason the movie sucks.\
> "But so and so great movie is completely jump scare free" you sure that nothing had a quick turn, a very sudden shift of pace, a smash cut, a moment of unexpected visual or auditive punch? It doesn't have to be a cat fakeout to be a jump scare, you know. I mean, it doesn't have to have one, but even if it doesn't, it's also not the reason it's great.

For my worth, jump scares are nothing more than the creation and capitalization of tension, everything after that is just execution preferences. When I see people say they dont like jump scares, then I look to their favorite horror movies, often they are chock full of em. So I think theres more to it than just a misunderstanding.

I think it owes its reputation in the general public (both for movie goes in general and for general horror fans) as a result of the lack of respect horror gets. It is a distillation of a problem I have with wider ranging and critically loved horror often not getting tagged as horror. High critical reception horror often gets tagged as thriller, drama, etc. I think in some way the commonly held opinion for jump scares in the current times is an internalization of this concept.

This view has shaped the definition of what a jump scare is for many people. If viewers start with the expectation that jump scares are inherently bad, then all the jump scares in good movies (and there are so many as my linked comment above explains) are not marked as good jump scares in peoples heads. This is especially true when it comes to horror movies with a light brush of arthouse influence. For example, in my opinion Hereditary had one of the best jump scares in the decade with the telephone pole. But people don’t recognize it as a jump scare scarily often.

Ive seen more comments than I can count wherein people say they don’t like jump scares, but then like movies that unequivocally include jump scares - because they like the movie. But when they don’t like a movie, the same sort of scenes are derided for being cheap jump scares. Not to say there aren't execution differences, there can be, but not always. And from my experience its not the execution of the jump scare itself that is usually the problem, but rather the movie it is in (to the viewer complaining). Bad movies that create and capitalize on tension are jump scares, but good ones are good film making. This really sets up the term jump scare at a massive disadvantage in peoples heads as on a per scene basis there is very little different between good and bad jump scares

I think the term is being used as a scape goat for general dislike of the movie. Peoples reaction to jump scares in a movie is more useful as a barometer for if a person enjoyed or did not like a horror movie holistically, vs it being an actual critique of the jump scares themselves.

As an addendum I also believe there is not an inherent negative value to startling a viewer. I think removed of many artistic aspects when we are discussing jump scares, you can not separate the fact that sometimes, as you pointed out yourself, sometimes the value lies in just startling the viewer for some popcorn entertainment. There is nothing wrong with that.
