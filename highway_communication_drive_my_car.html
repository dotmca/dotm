# Highway Communication - Drive My Car

I want to talk about my favorite scene in Drive My Car. Before I get into it, I wanted to expound on a specific aspect of Japanese culture. To put a better word to what I am describing, Japan has a culture of animism. Though this can sometimes be applied conveniently, overall it is more rooted in their culture than a similar concept in the US.

Shintoism assigns a soul - Reikon (霊魂) - to inanimate objects like trees or rocks. This sentiment proliferates the culture in general. Examples from some comments:
&gt; “Like when you&#39;re in a basketball club in a school they taught me to never kick the basketball and to apologize to the ball when I did kick it. The idea was that the rules of basketball prohibit you from kicking the ball so you should have respect for the ball and not kick it whether you&#39;re in a game or not. It&#39;s stupid. It&#39;s a piece of rubber.”

But in Japan, its not a terrible thing that they try to instill in people to have respect for these inanimate objects. They try to be thoughtful of who took the effort to create and bring that object for you to use. Have respect for the resources it required. The inventor. The labor it required. All of it. 

&gt; &quot;Ichiro(of the Seattle mariners) for example is known to treat his custom made baseball bats with respect and reverence. It&#39;s in stark contrast with when you might see an American player break a bat in anger. I&#39;m not knocking that expression of frustration at all..! Also the average player didn&#39;t get their bats custom made like Ichiro. Regardless what drives Ichiro&#39;s behavior there is remnants of animism as part of the culture.”

 Again, it&#39;s not a through and through philosophy. Plenty of examples of Japanese folks being frivolous with objects or the environment in general. But it can help add context to how Kafuku views and treats his car and how it may relate to his overall life.
 
 My favorite bits of the movie had to be the most dense parts where there was storytelling within storytelling. This sort of poetic storytelling seems to be more common in Japanese media than other media I&#39;ve consumed. I’ve talked about “showing without telling”, “telling without showing”, the underlying western influence for the former adage and dislike for the latter. Setting all of that aside, what I really enjoy (besides the mental effort) with the type of storytelling within storytelling highlighted in Drive My Car, is it does both in spades. Having a character tell a story that is technically unrelated, but when certain phrases of the stories are told, it is almost like narration as the director chooses what character to show on screen while the story/narration is happening.
 
 The scene at 5 minutes into the film is a perfect example of this. It has Oto and Kafuku describing a story that is technically meant for a TV script. I&#39;ve compiled the script into a paste:https://pastebin.com/z4x2BH62
 
 While they are describing a made-up story, the story itself is easy to plaster on Kafuku and Oto themselves. It is a vocaliziation, both diegetically and to the viewer, the feelings that stir within Oto. Specifically the fact that she feels like she can&#39;t stop, not only does the character within the story feel like she can&#39;t stop sneaking into the house, but that Oto herself feels like she can&#39;t stop her multiple partners. These type of scenes and this type of storytelling is all over the film.
 
 At the end of the day, I think one could hate on this type of dialog as the epitome of boring telling without showing, but I think how the director leverages what is on screen while the story is being told and who is telling the story adds depth to every interaction throughout. Unfortunately because of how obtuse than can be for those unfamiliar, this method of poetic storytelling beguiles the truth for some viewers.

My favorite overall scene has to be the conversation Takatsuki and Kafuku have in the car wherein he first communicates very indirectly who he is to Oto, then a little more clearly through the shared lamprey story, and finally fairly direct as far as Japanese communication standards go. He then leaves the car and Kafuku and Watari share a few words, after which he offers her a cig, to which they both light one and smoke in the car while holding them above in silence.

For your convenience of remembrance, I’ve pasted the conversation so you can give a quick read over to see exactly what is communicated (you’ll have to remember what and who the camera is focused on as the dialog passes)

Storytelling from Takatsuki: https://pastebin.com/nA7ZiYS3

Short words between Kafuku and Watari after: https://pastebin.com/G0s6TmS3

The scene then ends with a gunshot sound and a woman screaming as it cuts to the next scene; the theatrical play where Takatsuki finally gets complimented by Kafuku before he gets arrested.

Now, originally the main things I liked was the expositional style as covered above, contrasted with a small break in Japanese communication where the topic at hand is finally somewhat broached (I did some reading on Murakami and it kinda seems that he also is fairly critical of the communication culture within Japan. It seems like many artists within Japan -at least the ones I know- are, but the communication culture does lend itself to very nice storytelling), and the final non-verbal communication with the cigs. 

Some vocalizations of affection within Japan can take the form of very indirect messaging. An example I&#39;ve come across before is during an interview a woman was giving where she was asked how her husband proposed. What she said was something as follows (forgive my memory), &quot;He asked me to shine his shoes every morning&quot;. The implicit message there was that he wanted her to live with him, care for him, become part of his life etc.

Given the car that Kafuku ascribes so much to, the level of compliment he gives her driving, and him continuing to ask her to drive him places without specifying a location hides a deeper level of affection. To compound this, him not only allowing her to smoke, but inviting her to smoke and joining her silently was an extremely poignant message of trust and affection that should not be taken only literally as “he trusts her not to get his car dirty”.

Again this type of storytelling and the general culture of communication in Japan lends itself to layers of meaning, but given more time and reading, I found even more to enjoy from the scene. The penultimate shot wherein they show the cigs out of the sunroof contains more information than what is on the surface if the viewer has context and is willing to look.

The shot above evokes imagery of Japanese funeral incense, a visual that would be very familiar to a Japanese audience. With that connection in mind, recall that this entire scene happens before Kafuku and Watari vocally bond over feeling like they killed those close to them (wife and mother respectively). Adding in the context of the story that Takatuski just told, specifically this part:

&gt;&quot;I must take responsibility for what I&#39;ve done.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t pretend it didn&#39;t happen.&quot;

&gt;&quot;Because it definitely happened.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I definitely killed that man.&quot;

&gt;She searches under the planter
but the key is no longer there.

&gt;She stares at the surveillance camera.

&gt;Because it&#39;s the only change
she has elicited in this world.

&gt;She looks into the lens and

&gt;repeats her words over and over.

&gt;Clearly, so that she&#39;s understood,

&gt;&quot;I killed him.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I killed him.&quot;

&gt;&quot;I killed him.&quot;

&gt;This is as far as I know.

&gt;Maybe the tale ends there,
or maybe it continues.</pre></article><nav class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu teal" id="neuron-nav-bar"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="item" href="https://github.com/srid/neuron-template/edit/master/./highway_communication_drive_my_car.md" title="Edit this page"><i class="edit icon"></i></a><a class="right item" href="impulse" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></nav></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.35.3" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
