# Anime Production Terms

Many people misunderstand or misrepresent what creatives forces all work together to take an anime from production to finalization. You often see people excited for a new IP because of a certain studio instead of focusing on the actual creatives who are working on any given project. This article sets out to, at a high level, define some of the most common positions you would see if you looked up an anime on [Anime News Network(ANN)](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/)

**Series Composition**: Outside of producers, they make a lot of the final calls for the show, often they lead the discussion on overall story, tone, and pacing etc. Can be similar to a film director.

**Director**: Again these terms are all a bit fungible, but the director can often be also the Series Composition or they can be separate. When separate they usually take the vision of the Series Composition, and then direct it into an anime. Can also be similar to a film director

**Episode Director**: These people do the above but for a given episode, while taking into account the will of the series composition and director. Less flexibility, but still can be flexible with how they direct the episode.

**Screenplay writer**: The meat and potatoes of what I think is most important for some of the complaints. These people write the screen plays of the episodes they are given, based off of the story notions from the Series Director. This is often pretty collaborative with the series composition and director.

**Storyboarder**: Responsible for the paneling of all the scenes throughout an episode. This person is who you usually thank for cinematography, shot composition, action scene composition, etc. I think people have most likely seen story boards before, they look like rough sketches. 

**Animation Director**: Does the role of directing, but just for the animation aspects

**Key Animator**: Creates key frames for scenes based off of the story board.

**Animator**: There are a bunch of smaller animation roles I wonâ€™t all sum up, but this group of people do a lot of the legwork for the animation given key frames

**Studio**: A collection of creatives that fulfill the above roles (and more). While studios can seek out creatives with similar ideas or seek out similar types of stories, I like focusing on the actual people themselves more than the studio.

**Cour**: A block of episodes being produced. Usually meaning 12 episodes. 1 cour show is 12 ep, 2 cour 24 ep etc
