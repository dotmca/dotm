# Do not live by Show Don't Tell

A quick rant on the belief that "show dont tell" is objectively good.

It is an opinion piece, but its come up multiple times with varying degrees around the wests involvement with the concerts of what is considered good writing, and more specifically what I was looking at is screenwriting in particular.

I've wanted to discuss and/or write about the differences in what cultures expect out of exposition in media for a minute now, so heres a small snippet.

Its a long line of different articles and viewpoints ive come across and thought about myself as I continue to consume more and more media outside the west, or even outside of the US specifically. The above tangent was tied directly to the adage of show don't tell which has sat uneasily with me for a while, granted I think most adages do, when treated with fervency. Shit I'm even uneasy when they are treated not with full on fervency but as concepts that require a lot of backing to question or needing 'good reasons' to 'break a rule'.
The veracity of any single cause for the belief in the US of 'show dont tell' is def up in the air and I'm not gonna hitch my wagon to any specific thing, but it is interesting to see other written pieces about this particular rule and how it may have been shaped and the why

But really it all ties into curiosity around the aspects of storytelling I enjoy more than others. If what I enjoy in storytelling are more learned behaviors, highly influenced by outside factors, than something more objective. And while I think im fairly removed from objectivity in media to begin with at this point, the more important takeaway is if these things are learned, than it means I can, and have in the past, learned to enjoy different means of storytelling with understanding and effort.

I did not enjoy my initial uneasiness with voice overs, monologuing, and general tell but not showing musings in some of the french movies we've watched, and stalker as some examples. I also know that I've changed how I approach storytelling in the past wrt anime where extremely dialog heavy exposition is a lot more accepted. It was an initial cluein that storytelling is not nearly as set in stone as I believe
And while I think preferences will always exist, if they are so heavily shaped by external factors, than can I not just add more external factors?
