saving time and effort do not want to spend so much time on parts(or most) of the film that I love. The portrayal of mental illness, the commentary on couple dynamics in france, the superb switch from naturalistic to stylized filmmaking as the narrative progressed coupled with impressive acting and well written dialog, the interpretations on the greater political landscape - albeit against Marina de Vans intention. What I’d like to do is focus on is a small squabble regarding the use of gore within Dans Ma Peau, and the larger cannon as a whole.</p><p>As a preface, I’m speaking about this topic coming from my experiences and how I find it relates to my ingestion. I do try to expand it to audience members in general, but I obviously can not speak for everyone. Additionally while I believe this is how gore can function for me, I am aware that it may or may not have been the authors intent for using said gore.</p><p>Plainly, my dislike is representative of my feelings to the portrayal of self-harm within the movie and how I found it did not evoke as much mental trauma in the viewer as I’d have liked. And for my experience made the rest of the film, just slightly less impactful. The use of gore throughout French New Extremity has been done for a multitude of reasons, what I want to focus on is its use in causing something akin to extreme emotional vulnerability. Gore is not the only way to achieve this effect. Boot camp is one that is highly effective, honest traumatic events another, subliminal messaging with or without drugs and hypnosis a third. What all of these, any many other methods, do is break down the mental guards people have, both in their ability to rationally process information, and their ability to emotionally regulate. This is not how every depiction of violence is used explicitly in the New French Extremity films I’ve watched, but I maintain it is a by-product for all of them, intentional or not. Extreme, long cut, inescapable self harm scenes serves the same function for me.</p><p>I view it akin to something like an open wound. When I watch films with the intent of essentially controlled emotional self-harm, I need a catalyst. If we removed all the scenes of self harm from Dans Ma Peau, and left it implied with the aftereffects shown, I would undoubtably not be as moved by the film as a whole. All the other aspects of enjoyment mentioned above are lessened as a result. My emotional investment is neutered, as I have maintained my ability to emotionally regulate well enough, it would be a great drama no doubt, but the film would be certainly different. What theses scenes can do for me is to slowly pull open the emotional wound it made, wider and wider, deeper and deeper, until the nerves are exposed. When done well, the nerves can get flayed and cause what is something like self hypnosis. Like a ripped power cord with electricity still surging, emotional and mentally I can get broken down to the point where what I want is not as important as what the film is pouring into my eyes. I want to lose the ability to realize I am consuming a film, and be completely and utterly engrossed and broken. This emotional vulnerability then is carried throughout the film to astounding effect, my senses heightened to every slight emotion that is being portrayed.</p><p>This is not to say the film didn’t do this, I just had wished it had gone the full mile. These thoughts seem to be somewhat shared by Alexandra West.</p><blockquote><p>“Arutard believed that the Theatre of Cruelty could be achieved by new acting and directing practices which would be based more on movement and sound to shock the audience. This, he believed, would force them to pay attention, triggering their subconscious and primal reactions and, ultimately, eliciting a true reaction to the work”</p></blockquote><p>And while speaking about Trouble Every Day,</p><blockquote><p>“An emphasis on the surface images seems to replace the importance of narrative and dialogue: the contagions bodies…are cut adrift from any expository structure and left to circulate as volatile, tactile intensities throughout the film”</p></blockquote><p>My takeaway from these is less relevant to the films and theatre the quotes are in reference to, but the idea that you can trigger subconscious through image, film, and sound to cause an elevated level of intensity and reaction. Especially as Dans Ma Peau becomes decidedly less and less linear as the film progresses, and the expository structure does get minimized.</p><p>Now my understanding was that Marina de Van herself knew that this was a problem she had to try and solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There was the obvious visual problem in showing, or not showing, or deciding how much to show of her actions. But I can’t get excited about something which doesn’t present some kind of great difficulty. I’m not excited unless I’m really afraid to fail…”</p></blockquote><p>This was very obviously a focus point in her thinking and her portrayal of self harm on screen. She did end up deciding on what she did, which is more implied than shown, but I disagree with the decision. Again, the film itself is superb regardless, but for my tastes and experiences I feel like this was the largest dropped ball.</p><blockquote><p>“ I really wanted the audience to be affected strongly…. What was most important for me was the emotion of her curiosity, of the anguish you can feel at your body’s disconnect from you.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I couldn’t hide the blood. I couldn’t hide the gestures, but even in the scenes of incision or cutting, I systematically avoided filming the knife coming down, evoking violence that way”</p></blockquote><p>She then goes on to speak about her different portrayal of self harm when Esther was alone and it was meant to evoke some sensuality, which I thought were extremely well done. My issues lie with just the former use of self harm and how it was depicted. Now, Marina de Van can say that was her intent all well and good, but there were plenty of times where the cutting was shown on screen, most notably the dinner table scene. It is no surprise that for my money, it was the best self harming scene in the movie eliciting a windfall of emotional venerability in me, when trying to evoke the former feelings and not the sensuality.</p><p>West goes further on to mention the dinner scene specifically.</p><blockquote><p>“From the quick shots of those seated around the table and Esther’s own flesh, it becomes clear that she longs to cut herself. Whether it is to relieve tension or pain, the audience is not sure, but the designer is palpable. What is clear from De Van’s direction is that Esther can focus on nothing else”</p></blockquote><p>And it is true, as the scene progresses she can not focus on anything else, and as a viewer you can not either. You are forced to watch the knife penetrate the skin repeatedly without escape feeling closer and closer in psyche to Esther without knowing exactly why. The implication is not in whether the violence is or isn’t happening, but rather the implication is in the motive, the set of experiences that led her to this, her own grasp on her quickly fledgling life.</p><p>Skimming through the movie there were only 6 scenes of self harm. In the scenes of self harm that were implied, her initially cutting of her thigh, and after dinner, her cutting her other thigh both of these were framed in a way to remove visual information. A stylistic choice rather than one of necessity (as you could show the self harm and her face framed in both cases) I feel like they fell just short of acting as a catalyst for emotional jigging. The sensual cutting and subsequent cannibalism scenes were done so well that such a small complaint can be missed. Yet I yearn for a movie that breaks my psyche right before the sensual self harm, really wringing my soul out, rather than doing something just short of that.</p><p>Before I close out, I do want to touch on something which I personally think is misplaced in the general opinion, and for me absolutely is incorrect. Keri O’Shea, in her 15 year retrospective of Dans Ma Peau mentions that,</p><blockquote><p>“For the horror crowd enamoured of the blue-hued, unflinching gore of the decade, it perhaps seemed not quite a horror film; for those engaged by its domestic and personal themes, perhaps it was too much of a horror film.”</p></blockquote><p>A reviewer</p><blockquote><p>“Sound design did a lot of work here where another film might have, and others later in exploitation movement will, opt for make-up and gore. No doubt at least partly a budgetary decision, this made for greater tension in moments where the “action” was happening just out of frame, and most interestingly, allowed for grating, scraping auditory refrain in otherwise normal scenes.”</p></blockquote><p>The mistake I feel both of them, and much of the general populace makes, is that these are not competing sides of a coin. Adding more emotional catalyst through the use of breaking the conscious and subconscious with portrayed self harm does not make a film more of a horror film. It elevates the domestic and personal themes by leaving your emotions nerve cluster exposed and violated. Same with the second comment, there is nothing stopping films from having incredible make-up and sound design. For me, the tension in implied aspects of a movie do not translate to higher tension unilaterally. The outcome is quite contextual, and in this case did the opposite. Now I am a little more wired to be disgusted at realistic body horror, than many other types of horror, and so my expectations no doubt played a part here. But the scenes were not so overtly bad to put me into the perfect state emotionally as I would have liked from the film, the scenes that were implied yet not sensual (only 2 scenes) dragged a bit for me, muting my emotional response not elevating it. My mental faculties were able to not feel completely constrained, no matter how hard I tried to use the scenes as a catalyst.</p><p>I touched upon it a bit above, but a more rewarding use of implied information is motive, not action. This is especially true when the action itself is not implied, but explicitly known. There is a difference between a horror movie implying a monster, leading to greater tension, as the audience does not have the information yet, vs ‘implying’ actions that are explicitly known to the viewer. In this case the cutting of the right thigh, or the cutting of the left thigh. For my worth, this implication makes for less tension, as it is not implication at all, it is obfuscation of known action.</p><p>Finally, I believe that there would not be a negative audience reaction if she had modified those two scenes in the way I would have liked. Almost no one seeking out this movie would be put off by 2 scenes of more onscreen self harm ala the dinner table scene, and anyone who was not seeking out this movie, or who would not be able to stomach the current film, is even in consideration at this point.</p><p>Overall Dans Ma Peau was a fantastic film and honestly used most of the recurring themes, motifs, and aspects of the New French Extremity cannon in ways unrivaled so far that I’ve seen.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2022-01-23T20:55">2022-01-23</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane" id="neuron-backlinks-pane"><h3 class="ui header">Backlinks</h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="2022-01-22T01:39"><a href="Horror">Horror</a></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane" id="neuron-tags-pane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">horror</span></div></nav><nav class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu teal" id="neuron-nav-bar"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="item" href="https://github.com/srid/neuron-template/edit/master/./gore_in_dans_ma_peau.md" title="Edit this page"><i class="edit icon"></i></a><a class="right item" href="impulse" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></nav></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.35.3" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
